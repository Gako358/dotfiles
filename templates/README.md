# Nix Templates

Templates are there to help you start your Nix project.
Flakes are very handy to setup entirely pure, project-specific dependencies (not just dependencies, but build steps, shell environments and more) in a declarative way.

```
nix flake new -t github:gako358/dotfiles/templates#java
```
